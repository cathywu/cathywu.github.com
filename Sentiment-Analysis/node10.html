Feature Counting Method</A>
</H2>
There are several ways to construct a probability model for a set of document n-grams. The most obvious is to use feature frequency. The value of a feature in a given document is simply the number of times it appears in that document. Presence, on the other hand, attributes a value of 1 if a feature exists in a document and 0 otherwise.

<P>
As a whole (across all other parameters), training on presence rather than frequency performed on average 5.5% better for Naive Bayes, ranging from 0% to 10% improvement, with no particular outliers in other test configurations, from 73.1% accuracy with frequency to 78.5% accuracy with presence. There was no significant difference for SVMs and applying TF-IDF did not provide any improvement from using frequency for either. Both of these comparisons do not apply to Maximum Entropy.

<P>
Interestingly, for Naive Bayes, the positive and negative tests performed very differently between presence and frequency tests. Excluding verb tests, which did not exhibit this disparity, positive tests averaged 6.5% worse (up to 12% worse in the case) on presence tests while negative tests averaged 18.9% better (up to 30% better). There was an average aggregate difference of 25.4% between positive and negative results. By comparison, SVMs exhibited an average aggregate difference of 0.7%. These results provide evidence that training on presence rather than frequency yields models with less bias.
